Cyclisticâ€™s finance analysts have concluded that annual members are much more profitable than casual riders. Company manager Lily Moreno believes that maximizing the number of annual members will be key to future growth and there is a solid opportunity to convert casual riders into members. She notes that casual riders are already aware of the Cyclistic program and have chosen Cyclistic for their mobility needs.
